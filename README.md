Automated process to get rid of the viasat DAP screen
Also called a gateway capture but built for viasat

                                                             


enter a url to post to if DAP is detected it will logon.

recomended to work with DDNS get request like www.duckdns.org 




Can run anywhere PHP runs. 

run on a PI by calling by chron 

PHP exede.php >> /var/log/exede.log

or

PHP exede.php >/dev/null


I no longer use viasat so no updates. If they change something you are free to make changes. Send them to me and I will add them here.
